The information stored within these registers can be transferred with the help of shift registers. Shift Register is a group of flip flops used to store multiple bits of data. The bits stored in such registers can be made to move within the registers and in/out of the registers by applying clock pulses. An n-bit shift register can be formed by connecting n flip-flops where each flip flop stores a single bit of data. The registers which will shift the bits to left are called “Shift left registers”. The registers which will shift the bits to right are called “Shift right registers”.
